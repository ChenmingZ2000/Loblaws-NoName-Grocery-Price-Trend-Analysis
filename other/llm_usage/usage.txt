> loblaws_data <- loblaws_data %>% 
+   inner_join(size_mapping, by = c("product_id" = "product_id"))
Error in inner_join():
! Can't join x$product_id with y$product_id due to incompatible types.
ℹ x$product_id is a <double>.
ℹ y$product_id is a <character>.
Run rlang::last_trace() to see where the error occurred.

ChatGPT
The error occurs because the product_id column in loblaws_data is of type <double> (numeric) and the product_id column in size_mapping is of type <character>. To resolve this, you need to ensure both columns have the same type before performing the inner_join.

Here’s how to fix the issue:

Solution
Convert the product_id column in both loblaws_data and size_mapping to the same type.
Convert both to <character> (recommended).
Alternatively, convert both to <double>.
Updated Code
r
library(dplyr)

# Convert `product_id` to character in both datasets
loblaws_data <- loblaws_data %>%
  mutate(product_id = as.character(product_id))

size_mapping <- size_mapping %>%
  mutate(product_id = as.character(product_id))

# Perform the join
loblaws_data <- loblaws_data %>%
  inner_join(size_mapping, by = "product_id")

# View the resulting data
head(loblaws_data)
Explanation
mutate(product_id = as.character(product_id):

Converts product_id to <character> in both datasets to ensure compatibility for the join.
inner_join:

Combines rows where product_id matches in both datasets.
head(loblaws_data):

Displays the first few rows of the resulting dataset to confirm the join was successful.
Optional: Convert to Numeric
If you prefer to use <double> for product_id, you can instead convert both columns to numeric:

r
loblaws_data <- loblaws_data %>%
  mutate(product_id = as.numeric(product_id))

size_mapping <- size_mapping %>%
  mutate(product_id = as.numeric(product_id))

# Plot price trends over time by product_id
selected_ids <- c("1870038", "1876096", "1870067", "1870043", "1876747")

filtered_data <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(product_id %in% selected_ids)

ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = date, y = current_price, group = product_id, color = as.factor(product_id))) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.7, size = 1) +
  labs(x = "Date", 
       y = "Price", 
       title = "Price Trend for Selected Products by Date",
       subtitle = "Product randomly selected",
       color = "Product ID") +
  theme_minimal()
How would you display the product name and size next to the product id in the graph legend

ChatGPT
In ggplot2, you can use geom_text() or geom_label() to annotate each line in the plot with its corresponding product_name and size. Below is the improved code:

Improved Code:
r
# Select specific product_ids
selected_ids <- c("1870038", "1876096", "1870067", "1870043", "1876747")

# Filter the dataset
filtered_data <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(product_id %in% selected_ids)

# Get the last date's value for each product_id to add annotations
label_data <- filtered_data %>%
  group_by(product_id) %>%
  filter(date == max(date)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(label = paste(product_name, size, sep = ", "))  # Create labels: product name and size

# Create the plot
ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = date, y = current_price, group = product_id, color = as.factor(product_id))) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.7, size = 1) +
  geom_text(data = label_data, 
            aes(x = date, y = current_price, label = label, color = as.factor(product_id)),
            hjust = -0.1, vjust = 0.5, size = 3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Date", 
       y = "Price", 
       title = "Price Trend for Selected Products by Date",
       subtitle = "Products randomly selected",
       color = "Product ID") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
Code Details:
Create label_data:

Use group_by(product_id) and filter(date == max(date)) to extract the last record for each product_id (i.e., the endpoint of each line).
Use mutate(label = paste(product_name, size, sep = ", ")) to create labels combining the product name and size.
Use geom_text() to Add Labels:

Specify label = label in geom_text() to add annotations.
hjust = -0.1 places the label to the right of the line, while vjust = 0.5 vertically aligns the text.
Enhance Legends and Labels:

theme(legend.position = "bottom") positions the legend at the bottom of the plot.
The legend colors match the line colors for easy identification.
Output:
Each line's endpoint will display the corresponding product_name and size.
This makes it easier to identify the trends associated with each product's ID, name, and size.
